# Factorials

## Description

Write a function that accepts a postive number and returns the factorial of that number. 

For example:
```javascript
    factorial(4)
    => 24
```

NOTE: A factorial of any positive number is the product of all of the digits from 1 to that number. To explain the above example:
* 1x2 = 2
* 2x3 = 6
* 6x4 = 24

Our end result is 24.
