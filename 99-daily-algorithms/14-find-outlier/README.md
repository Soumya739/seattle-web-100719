# Find the Parity Outlier
Given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer *n*. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" *n*.

## Examples:
```javascript
findOutlier([1,3,5,7,4,9,11,3])
    => 4
```
```javascript
findOutlier([2,8,3,6,4,8,0])
    => 3
```
