# Largest Swap

## Description

Write a function that accepts a two-digit number and determines if it's the larges of two possible digit swaps, and returns a boolean. 

For example:
```javascript
    largestSwap(27)
    => false
```

The alternative swap for 27 is 72. Because 72 is the larger of the two, the function will return false. Here are a few more examples:

```javascript
    largestSwap(99)
    => true
```
```javascript
    largestSwap(14)
    => false
```
```javascript
    largestSwap(10)
    => true
```
