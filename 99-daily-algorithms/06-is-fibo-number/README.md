# Is Fibo Number?
You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci sequence.

A [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html) is one where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1. 

## Example

```
Input: 5
Output: Is Fibo
```

```
Input: 7
Output: Is Not Fibo
```
```
Input: 8
Output: Is Fibo
```

## Explanation: 

 * 5 is a Fibonacci number given by fib<sub>5</sub> = 3 + 2
 * 7 is not a Fibonacci number
 * 8 is a Fibonacci number given by fib<sub>6</sub> = 5 + 3
