# Object-Oriented JavaScript / Intermediate JS / Slightly Advanced JS
Let's learn about classes and advanced syntax before TDay!

## Wait But Why?
- Easier to organize our code
- Easier to share, reuse, and edit code at a later date
- Necessary for React development
- Don't have a dumpster fire of functions and variables floating around

## Main Goals
By the end of this lesson, we will be able to (with some help from documentation or the Great Google):
- Declare a class in JS and instantiate objects from it
- Use arrow syntax to create functions
- Destructure arrays and objects
- Increase confidence using array methods, such as map and filter
- Explain the difference between passing and calling a function

## Breathe
You aren't expected to memorize or completely understand this all the way. We're throwing a lot at you today because of the break and we want to help you prepare for Mod 4.

## We'll take a break half way through lecture

## Topics
- Class declarations
- Instance methods and variables
- Class methods and variables
- Inheritance
- Syntactic sugar (prototypal inheritance)
- this (context) and binding, window and undefined
- Arrow functions and the great parentheses and more this
- Traditional method declaration vs arrow declaration in a class
- Destructuring assignment
- Array methods
- Functions: Parens vs no parens

## Bonus Topics If We Have Time
- Private instance variables
- Closing over a class (closure)
- Four pillars of object-oriented programming
